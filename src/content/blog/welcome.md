# Hi There

I'm Adam, and I've been writing software since I was 9 years old. That's 34 years now, which is wild to say out loud. When I was a kid, coding was the thing that got me excited the way other kids got excited about baseball. The difference is I actually got to grow up and do it for a living. I'm a senior software engineer at Red Hat, and these days I work in AI engineering on applied autonomous code generation, which is exactly as fun as it sounds.

Over the years I've bounced around the stack. I was a hardcore Ruby and Vue person for a long time, did a lot of work with Backstage, and now my world is mostly Python, Go, TypeScript, and React. Full stack, whatever needs building.

## What This Site Is About

This is where I put my open source work. I write software and I release it because I think code should be open. It's good for everybody. Some of it might be useful to you, some of it might be fun to poke around in, and some of it might help you learn something new. Any of those outcomes is a win in my book.

## What to Expect on the Blog

I'll be writing about a few different things here:

- **Project announcements** — when I ship something new or push a meaningful update, I'll write about it here. What it does, why I built it, how it works.
- **Tutorials and how-tos** — stuff I've figured out that I wish someone had written down for me. Practical, hands-on, skip-the-fluff kind of posts.
- **Dev thoughts** — opinions on tools, languages, patterns, and whatever else is rattling around in my head. I've been doing this long enough to have some takes.

## Come Say Hi

If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. Check out my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/adamrdrew), poke through the projects on this site, and keep an eye on the blog. I'm glad you're here.
