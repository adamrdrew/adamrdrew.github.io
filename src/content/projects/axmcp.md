AxMCP exposes the macOS accessibility system to AI agents through MCP. Inspect any running application's UI tree, find elements by role or attribute, perform actions (click, press, set value), and observe changes in real time.

Built in Swift, distributed via Homebrew. Designed for AI agents that need to understand and interact with the visual interface of macOS applications.

Install via Homebrew:
```bash
brew tap adamrdrew/axmcp
brew install axmcp
```
