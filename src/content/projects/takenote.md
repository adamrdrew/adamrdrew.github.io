TakeNote is a native markdown editor for Mac, iPad, and iPhone, built entirely in SwiftUI. It stores notes as plain `.md` files in iCloud Drive, so your notes are always accessible outside the app — in Finder, in any text editor, on any device.

Features:
- **Live markdown preview** with syntax highlighting
- **iCloud sync** across all Apple devices
- **Keyboard-first** design — everything is reachable without the mouse
- **File-based storage** — no proprietary database, no lock-in
- **Universal app** — a single codebase for Mac, iPad, and iPhone

TakeNote is what happens when you want Bear or iA Writer but don't want to surrender your files to an opaque sync engine. Your notes are files. Full stop.
