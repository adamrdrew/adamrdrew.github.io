Spotlight MCP gives AI agents access to macOS Spotlight's indexed search. Find files by content, name, kind, date range, or metadata — the same search that powers Finder and the system search bar, available programmatically through MCP.

Install via Homebrew:
```bash
brew tap adamrdrew/spotlight-mcp
brew install spotlight-mcp
```
